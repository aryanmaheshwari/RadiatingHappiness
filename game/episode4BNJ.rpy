    Narrator "Once you finished getting ready, you boarded the bus that would take you to the culinary institute's auditorium."
    Narrator "It was a short ride but it gave you time to create expectations for the event."
    Narrator "After reaching the auditorium, you paid for your ticket and found a seat that had a good view of the station Jay was assigned to and Oh!"
    Narrator "He spotted you and waved. It was a good thing we came so we could see that bright smile."
    Narrator "Watching Jay masterfully chop the ingredients up and work precisely to cook them the right amount stirred something awake in you that you were not yet aware of."
    Narrator "Wow he's really cool when he becomes serious"
    Narrator "You could only wear a smile as you became entranced with his professional air."
    Narrator "Soon enough the results of the competition came out with Jay being only in second place."
    Narrator "A shame but still pretty high for a junior. He would definitely have a bright future ahead of him, maybe you could be a part of it."

    Jaylin "hey [main]! I'm so happy you made it, you being there really made me feel like I could win :)"
    Main "You were amazing! Even without our support you would do wonderfully, do you have any plans to celebrate after this?"
    Jaylin "Oh yeah, about that, I was wondering if you  would like to try the meal I cooked? That's only if you're comfortable with it of course. Ya know what I shouldn't have asked, you've probably already eaten-"

    Jaylin "Haha, you flatter me. I was actually also going to ask, would you perhaps want to go to Christmas in the Park with me?"
    Main "Yeah! Jellie was actually talking about it, we were planning on going!"
    Jaylin "Oh I actually meant just us?"
    Main "Just us? um sure!"
    Jaylin "Alright! It's a date, I can't wait! â™¡"
