    Jellie "Yeah go ahead, whats up"
    Main "Do you think going on a date with Jay will be weird?"
    Jellie "Hmm, depends. Do you think you could see him in a romantic way? Because if not maybe its better to just decline the date and keep your friendship."

                    Narrator "With a smile you closed your eyes and the rest was history. Maybe college wasn't too bad after all."

    Narrator "At some point, you tripped and Jay grabbed your hand to steady you. He didnâ€™t let go after you were alright, however, and you might have been just fine with that. "

    Narrator "Amused by his refusal to let you buy him anything you spend the next minutes trying to figure out what he would want as a present."
    Narrator "With you spitting out random guesses that get worse every time and him denying every single one, you two fall into laughter."
    Narrator "After the 10 millionth guess and 10 millionth denial, his pout seems just too cute for you too handle."
    Narrator "Before you know it you find yourself leaning in and meeting his lips with yours."
    Narrator "Let it be known that the shock of his crush kissing him jolted him so bad that Jay opened his eyes for the first time and boy were they beautiful."
    Narrator "You'd have to kiss him more often to see those eyes again. Not that you mind"
    Narrator "After all, winter is not such a cold season."
