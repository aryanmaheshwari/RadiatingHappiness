    Jellie "Oh okay, my bad I was just wondering since you guys have been talking so much lately"

    Main "Don't worry about it, I'm just surprised you'd see us that way, lets just go support him!"
    Narrator "After reaching the auditorium, you two paid for your tickets and found seats that had a good view of the station Jay was assigned to and Oh!"
    Narrator "He spotted you guys and waved. It was a good thing we came so we could see that bright smile."
    Jellie "For now, let's let him concentrate on the competition. We can talk to him afterwards!"
    Narrator "Watching Jay masterfully chop the ingredients up and work precisely to cook them the right amount stirred something awake in you that you were not yet aware of."
    Jellie "Wow he's really cool when he becomes serious"
    Narrator "You could only nod your head as you became entranced with his professional air."
    Narrator "Soon enough the results of the competition came out with Jay being only in second place."
    Narrator "A shame but still pretty high for a junior. He would definitely have a bright future ahead of him, maybe you could be a part of it."
